## Getting Started

Clone this repository locally:

``` bash
git clone https://github.com/AllanLancioni/i18n-manager.git
```

Install dependencies with npm :

``` bash
npm install
```

If you want to generate Angular components with Angular-cli , you **MUST** install `@angular/cli` in npm global context.  
Please follow [Angular-cli documentation](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) if you had installed a previous version of `angular-cli`.

``` bash
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

## To build for development

- **in a terminal window** -> npm start  

Voila! You can use your Angular + Electron app in a local development environment with hot reload !

The application code is managed by `main.ts`. In this sample, the app runs with a simple Angular App (http://localhost:4200) and an Electron window.  
The Angular component contains an example of Electron and NodeJS native lib import.
